# DEG-InD-Exporter
This tool helps automate exports of different quality PDF files from InDesign.

**Installation**

Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/dankyyyyy/deg-ind-exporter/releases).

Download the latest release.

Extract the file from the archive and place it somewhere easy for you to access.

**Setting up**

    1. Open Adobe InDesign.
    2. Navigate to Window > Utitlies > Scripts.
    3. Right click on one of the folders and click on "Reveal in Explorer"/"Reveal in Finder".
    4. Paste the script file into the folder.
    5. Close and reopen the Scripts tab to reload it.
    6. You're ready to export!

**Before starting**

    Make sure you have three export presets in InDesign with the following names:
    
    lowres
    
    medres
    
    print
    
    Capitalization matters, so name them exactly as you see them above.
    The settings of those presets are up to you to decide, but it would be good if they are standard across the department.

**Using the script**
    
    When your document is ready to export, simply:
    1. Open the Scripts menu in InDesign.
    2. Double-click the script to run it.
    3. Select an output folder. That's where your files will save.
    4. Select a language from the diaogue menu.
    5. Wait for your export to finish and verify it.
